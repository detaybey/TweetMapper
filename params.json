Then whole tweet list is dumped into an Excel file. \r\n\r\nFor Geocoding, Yandex's Map API is used. For API access I used @exister's YandexGeocoder library https://github.com/exister/YandexGeocoder\r\n\r\nYou can customize the code for accessing twitter API, appconfig contains credentials for a dummy app I created on twitter.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
